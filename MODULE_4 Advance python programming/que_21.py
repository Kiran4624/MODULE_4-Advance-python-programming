"""What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java :


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts are principles that govern the organization and
design of code in an object-oriented programming language.
Classes and Objects: Classes are blueprints for creating objects,
which are instances of classes. Classes define the properties (attributes) and 
behaviors (methods) of objects.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. 
It restricts access to the inner workings of an object and only exposes necessary interfaces to interact with it.

Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class  to inherit properties and behaviors from another class . 
It promotes code reuse and supports the concept of the "is-a" relationship.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
It enables a single interface to be used for different data types or objects, leading to code flexibility and extensibility.

Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details while exposing essential features. 
It allows programmers to focus on high-level concepts without worrying about low-level implementation details.

In Java, multiple inheritance is not supported in the same way as it is in some other programming languages like C++. Java supports only single inheritance, 
where a class can inherit from only one superclass.
