""" How many except statements can a try-except block have? Name Some 
built-in exception classes: 

A try-except block in Python can have multiple except statements to handle different types of exceptions. There's no hard limit to the number of except statements you can have in a try-except block. You can handle as many different types of exceptions as needed.

Here are some built-in exception classes in Python:

ZeroDivisionError: Raised when division or modulo by zero is encountered.
TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
ValueError: Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.
IndexError: Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range.
KeyError: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.
FileNotFoundError: Raised when a file or directory is requested but cannot be found.
PermissionError: Raised when trying to perform an operation that requires certain permissions.
NameError: Raised when a local or global name is not found.
IOError: Base class for I/O-related errors.
AttributeError: Raised when an attribute reference or assignment fails. """
